# How to Contribute

This project is a club project for the Computer Science and Engineering Club at CSU, San Bernardino, so the first step in contributing is to be a dues-paying member of the club.

The goal of this project is to create a new website for the club, with a collection of features to facilitate anything and everything the club needs, but it is also to give members an opportunity to learn web development by working on an actual project. As such we are very willing to assist people in developing skills.

To get started, follow the directions on the repository wiki. All commits are expected to conform to the guidelines given there.
